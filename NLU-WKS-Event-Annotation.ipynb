Another car was traveling east when suddenly the other vehicle veered at speed across the median strip into the path of my wifes car. His car spun and ended up facing west in the right lane in front of our car. She hit the brakes but had insufficient time to stop and our car collided with the other car. My wife rolled the car down the hill to a safe place to pull over. The other driver ran down to my wife and daughter to see if they were OK and said he was sorry but that he had lost control of his car. He then ran off. The ambulance and police arrived. My wife and daughter were examined on the scene and then taken to Midland where they were further examined. Thankfully it would appear that they have only had minor injuries.

Conditions where such that we could not pull off the road due to soft shoulders and I slowly continued until we found a safe spot to stop. Upon inspection we noticed a number of panels had come off the bumper and the bumper also seemed to have some minor damage. Most of the damage is on the left side where it seems that the side metal panel also had damage. All the lights were still working and when driving further no warning lights came on.
